To compile our operating system, run:
./compileOS.sh

If this does not work, you may need to run:
chmod +x compileOS.sh

This tells the machine that this file is executable

The compileOS.sh script will create a floppy disk image
It will be named 'floppya.img'
All other files produced in the process will be removed

To test the image with qemu, run:
qemu-system-i386 -fda floppya.img --boot order=a

The program will print "Hello World" to the console at the top left
